    // 1. At the instruction enqueue time, it is set to (enqueue cycle + 1) to avoid starting to execute the instruction immediately in the same cycle;

    // 3. During the instruction execution, it is used to track the synchronous memory access latency (current cycle + request latency) and instruction retirement time.
    // In order to distinguish between the first two cases in the FSM, and ensure that instruction latency is only modeled once,
    // we seperate index insn_ongoing (with timestamp of purpose 2 or 3) from insn_first_waiting (with timestamp of purpose 1).
